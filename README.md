## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Multi-Dataset Approach
- **Davidson Dataset**: Hate speech and offensive language detection
- **ETHOS Dataset**: Multilingual hate speech detection
- **HatemojiCheck Dataset**: Emoji-based hate speech analysis
- **Custom Emoji Processing**: Advanced emoji-to-text conversion

### ðŸ§  Model Architecture
- **DistilBERT-based Models**: Fine-tuned for each specific dataset
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple specialized models
- **Text Preprocessing**: Advanced preprocessing including emoji handling
- **Multi-class Classification**: Hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: PyTorch with Transformers library
- **Tokenization**: DistilBERT tokenizer with custom preprocessing
- **Training**: Custom training loops with validation
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics and analysis

## Datasets Used

1. **HatemojiCheck** (`HannahRoseKirk/HatemojiCheck`)
   - Focus on emoji-based hate speech detection
   - Includes various test groups and functionality checks

2. **Davidson Hate Speech** (`tdavidson/hate_speech_offensive`)
   - Classic hate speech detection dataset
   - Three-class classification: hate speech, offensive language, neither

3. **ETHOS Dataset**
   - Multilingual hate speech detection
   - Binary and multi-label classification tasks

## Key Preprocessing Features

### Emoji Processing
```python
def process_text_with_emojis(text):
    # Convert emojis to descriptive text
    # Handle spacing and formatting
    # Clean and normalize output
```

### Text Normalization
- **Leet speak conversion**: (4â†’a, 3â†’e, 1â†’i, 0â†’o)
- **Social media cleaning**: Remove @mentions, RT, hashtags
- **URL removal**: Clean web links
- **Character normalization**: Handle repeated characters

## Model Architectures

### DistilBERT Classifier
```python
class DistilBERTClassifierDavidsonDataset(PreTrainedModel):
    def __init__(self, config, weights=None):
        # DistilBERT backbone
        # Custom classification layers
        # Dropout regularization
```

### Training Configuration
- **Batch Size**: 64 (optimized for hardware)
- **Learning Rate**: Adaptive with scheduler
- **Validation Strategy**: Stratified train/validation/test splits
- **Hardware Optimization**: Thread limiting for JupyterHub EPFL

## Results and Performance

The project achieved successful implementation across multiple datasets with:
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
